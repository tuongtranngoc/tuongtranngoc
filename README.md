## :octocat: Biography
I am an AI Engineer in machine learning, focusing on computer vision, the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing algorithms, and their real-world applications.
+ **Object Detection/Segmentation/Pose Estimation**
+ **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
+ **Document Intelligence**

I have a background in mathematics and informatics, having graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology (HUST). Since then, I have been deeply engaged in artificial intelligence, constantly expanding my knowledge through work experience.

My professional experience began at [VNPT-AI](https://icenter.ai/vi), where I developed computer vision-based algorithm optimization for VNPT Smart Vision, such as warning detection, and action object identification. After that, I worked on Document Intelligence problems at [Eastgate-SoftWare](https://eastgate-software.com/).
