## :octocat: Biography
I am an AI Research Engineer and working at Eastgate-Software. Prior to that, I have had the fortune of working at [VNPT-AI Center](https://icenter.ai/vi) and [iCOMM Media & Tech, Jsc](https://icomm.vn/).

I have a background in mathematics and informatics, having graduated from Ha Noi University of Science and Technology (HUST). Since then, I have been deeply engaged in artificial intelligence, constantly expanding my knowledge through work experience.
